# OrderGenie AI – Monorepo Structure

This repo uses a future-proof, production-grade structure with all folders for MVP **and** later phases (multi-tenancy, AI, platform, etc.).

- **MVP/Phase 1:** Core restaurant + admin features (code-filled now)
- **Phase 2+**: Platform, AI, onboarding, and advanced features (empty or “// TODO” files for now)
- **Why:** Makes scaling, onboarding, and CI/CD simple

**Conventions:**
- Empty files = placeholder for future code (usually marked with `// TODO`)
- All folders committed to git for clarity
- Add your code as you reach each phase!

For a full explanation, see `docs/development/README.md`.
